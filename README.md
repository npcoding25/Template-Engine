## Objective 

To build a software team generator, command line application that takes user input and displays it in a formatted html page.

## Installation

Run 'npm install'

## Tests

Run 'npm run test'

## Functionality

After running node app.js the user undergoes a series of questions about the software team. The first group of questions asks for the manager's name, email and office number, then asks how many team members the user wants. There are two types of team members that can be added, an engineer or an intern.

Engineer:

* Name
* Email
* Github

Intern:

* Name
* Email
* School

The app will loop through questions to aquire the info based on what type of employee the user wants. After gathering all the info, it creates an output folder that contains 'team.html'. Once opened on the browser you can see an organized group of cards containing the info, that will look good on any screen size.

## Improvements

Color schemes are not my thing. I think the colors look ok but I know it could have looked better with different colors. Also I could have centered the cards in iphone view.
